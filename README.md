# Weather-Journal App Project 
This Is My Second Project and I actually Used All The Skills That I Have Learned From The Course.



## How to use 
* All You Should Do Is To Write The Zip Code Of Any State Inside The United States.
* Write Your Feelings If You Want.
* The Application Will Show You.
  - The Name Of The City. 
  - The Temperature.
  - Weather Icon.
  - Description Of Weather.
  - The Date.
  - Your Feelings.

  
# I Hope You Liked The App and Have Fun With it ^^
